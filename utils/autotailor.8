.SH NAME
autotailor \- CLI tool for tailoring of SCAP datastreams.
.SH DESCRIPTION
autotailor produces tailoring files that SCAP-compliant scanners can use to complement SCAP datastreams.
A tailoring file adds a new profile, which is supposed to extend a profile that is already present in the datastream. 

Tailoring can add or remove rules, and it can redefine contents of XCCDF variables.

The tool requires datastream location and ID of the base profile as inputs.
Note however, that the referenced datastream is not opened, and the validity of tailoring is not checked against it.
The tool doesn't prevent you from extending non-existent profiles, selecting non-existent rules, and so on.

.SH USAGE
.SS Modify a variable value
$ autotailor --var-value xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_value_var_screensaver_lock_delay=120 -o tailoring.xml ssg-rhel8-ds.xml xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci_dss

The utility allows you to specify the ID namespace using the --namespace-id option, so you don't have to repeat the xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_... prefix everywhere.
The default namespace ID is actually org.ssgproject.content, so the following invocations are equivalent to the first one:

$ autotailor --var-value var_screensaver_lock_delay=120 --namespace-id org.ssgproject.content -o tailoring.xml ssg-rhel8-ds.xml pci_dss

$ autotailor --var-value var_screensaver_lock_delay=120 -o tailoring.xml ssg-rhel8-ds.xml pci_dss

The tailoring tailoring_file defines a new profile, xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci_dss_customized, which alters the screensaver lock delay.

.SS Perform more modifications
$ autotailor --var-value var_screensaver_lock_delay=120 --select gconf_gnome_screensaver_idle_delay --var-value inactivity_timeout_value=600 ssg-rhel8-ds.xml pci_dss

Use the --help option to learn about other options and their usage.
